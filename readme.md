# Python Gaming Sandbox

In this program, I have created a few different types of Python games, following some of the ideas presented in the book "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" by Al Sweigart

# Included Games
This repository includes versions of the following games:

**Dragon Realm**: Dragon Realm is a text-based RPG that has players exploring the caverns of Heracne, a mystical world filled with dragons and magic. The players will, in a choose your adventure-style game, find the cave with treasure and hope they can make it back alive!

**Guessing Game**: The Guessing Game will have everyone clamoring for more! In this game, we choose a random number between 1 and 20. The objective of the game is to guess the number correctly. But be careful! You will only have 5 guesses.

**Hangman**: A recreation of the familial favorite game, Hangman. 

**Joke Teller**: In this, we teach our program to tell jokes! We have programmed 5 different puns and jokes for our program to choose from. Use on at your next event!
